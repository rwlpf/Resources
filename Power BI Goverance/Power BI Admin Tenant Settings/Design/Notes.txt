Notes:
For the Tenant Settings Buttons, when clicked the background of the button set the whole colour to the outline (dark greenyblue colour). Will pop since the font is white.
Top 3 boxes, align the Number and Title a bit more centre so it's not at the bottom of each box. (suggestion, maybe use a separate shape and then the card invisible on top since pbi can be a bit finickity)
Tooltip:
Change the colour, from red to what?
make the font bigger, so it fills each card
maybe make the card a bit smaller or rounded
add a background colour so the card shows up more and looks more pop-y?
underneath the details, drill through to the details to get comments etc
maybe add the comment to the tooltip?
darren has an idea for the tooltips, let's do some sketches..
sketch: instead of having the whole box coloured, maybe have a small indicator for colour, or a tick for true?
