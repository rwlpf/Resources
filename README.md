Winne-The-Pooh said of himself, "For I am a bear of very little brain..."

Given that I find lots of interesting shiny things over time and often forget them again. This is a repository for collecting the shiny things that I find. One (bad) habit that I have is sharing the shiny things that I've found with others; the challenge is there is so much by collecting all these items here in one place all the nice shiny things to see them.

Did I miss something? Then let me know; my contact details are in the profile :-)
