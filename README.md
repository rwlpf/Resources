Winne-The-Pooh said of himself "“For I am a bear of very little brain..."

Given that I find lots of interesting shiny things over time and often forget them again.  This is a respository for collecting the shiny things that I find.  One (bad) habit that I have is shareing the shiny things that I've found with others, the challange is there is some much.  This hopefully collects in one place all the nice shiny things so that everyone can see them.

Did I miss something then let me know, my contact details are in the profile :->
