Top 5 Reasons to Become a BETTER Listener 

1)When speaking you are repeating what you know, when you are listening you are learning something new 

2)Every single human being has a golden nugget which you can learn from and it can transform your life 

3)one reason we do not listen is we are scared we might hear an opposing opinion, if we did they we would be living and an echo chamber, who wants to live in that type of world. Other people see thing differently and we can learn from that.  They can see things we cannot see. 

4)People are often just waiting to speak, so your unique point of view and contribution might be missed especially those of others so stop and listen 

5)when you listen you build better connections with others 

Remember to ask more questions !
