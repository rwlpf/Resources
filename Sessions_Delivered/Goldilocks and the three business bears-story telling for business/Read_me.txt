Welcome there are some markdown documents which can be opened using any program which can open text files.

This is not a complete list, they are for you to explore maybe find out a little more.  Many of these files are from this GitHub repo - https://github.com/rwlpf/Resources. This is where I will add more material as and when I find it.

Enjoy.
