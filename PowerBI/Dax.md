This where you will find lots of information and training about DAX from Marco Russo and Alberto Ferrari.
I've heard them refered to as the Two Italians, they are both from Italy and have IMHO lovely italian accents.  The site has both free and paid for training, both of which I would recommend. There are also a number of other free tools such as DAX studio and quite a few others here -> https://www.sqlbi.com/tools/
