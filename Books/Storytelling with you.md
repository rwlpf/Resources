Storytelling with you
plan, create, and deliver a stellar presentation
Cole Nussbaumer Knaffic

TL: DR - if you find yourself presenting to a group of people, this is a book you should read. Using stories and experience, the author covers every point that a presenter needs to be considering. 

I was impressed that it was possible to write about storytelling and yet, at the same time, use stories to illustrate the relevant points. The book starts with the most important yet often neglected topic of the audience. Then, moving on, consider how to create the story and craft it. Next, when looking at how to present the story, the words you might use to communicate that story presenting in graphs and images. The last chapter focuses on the presenter. The advice in the later chapters is invaluable and needs to be communicated more oftenâ€”straightforward recommendations to rehearse the presentation. Something, not all presenters do, yet the dividends from this practice alone are significant.

I recommend buying this if you do any presenting at all, something in this for everyone.
