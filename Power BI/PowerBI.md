Power BI is an amazing tool there is no  doubt about that.  What about all the other messy stuff to do with people, who has access to data.  What do can they do, how do they do, what roles do ther preform. Have you thought about data dictionaries, master data managment?  These and many other subjects are reviewed as part of this series, all topics which I have had to deal with in other companies and projects.
