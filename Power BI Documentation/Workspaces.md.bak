## Suggested Best practice

Recommended **not to use** the following words in the name of a workspace - 
- Power BI
- Workspace

Avoid the use of a backslash ‘/’ in the workspace name Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 autogenerates folder names for Dataflows in the background.  This character is used to separate folders. 
The name of the workspace should reflect the content of the workspace, for example 

 - Sales  
 - Sales Client 
 -  Finance General 
 - Finance Analytic 
 - Marketing

Note that it is not possible to have subfolders underneath a workspace.  So, consider using subject or departmental names and subject matter to help define workspace names. 

If using multiple workspaces for different parts of development then this could be appended to the end of the workspace name, for example 
 - Sales [Dev] 
  - Sales [UAT] 
  - Sales 
  - Finance General [Dev] 
  - Finance General [UAT] 
  - Finance General  
   - Sales -Dataflow's [Dev] 
   - Sales [UAT] 
   - Sales 
   - Finance General [Dev] 
   - Finance General [UAT] 
   - Finance General 
   - Finance Month End 
   - Finance Reconciliation [UAT] [R]  
   - Sales Analytics 
   - Marketing [Public]
Note that any workspace without the suffix [Dev] or [UAT] is the Production workspace  

**Suggestions for Workspace suffixes** 

[Test] - Testing content used for testing purposes 
[Dev] - Development content is being actively developed 
[Public] - Content is shared publicly eg published to the web 
[Team] - Content is managed by a team of people 
[R] - Restricted content, the data in the workspace is sensitive  

**Workspace Naming - Tips / hints / suggestions** 
The prefix will allow sorting and searching giving some consideration to that will help people find the workspaces they want. 
Use images – it is possible to assign an image (jpg or png). Adding an image to the workspace might make it easier to find the workspaces.
